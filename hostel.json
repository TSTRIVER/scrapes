    "overview": "The benefits of living in a hostel, for a student, are obvious. Hostels enable students to interact and mix with other like-minded students that hail from all over the country. They enable interactions between people from various backgrounds, enabling diversity. Keeping in mind the above, IIIT Bhopal provides excellent hostels to all its girls and first year boys in Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya, Bhopal.",
    "overview2": "Hostels have all the basic amenities that students need, such as gym, vegetarian mess, spacious open grounds, hot water during winters etc. Hostel co-ordinators, appointed by the students among themselves, get to decide the mess menu and look after the systematic functioning of the hostels, which eradicates any problems faced by the hostellers. Students residing in hostels also celebrate various functions on a small scale, like Birthday parties, dusshera, holi, New Year etc. To ensure maximum privacy, all first year boys are provided single rooms."
